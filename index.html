                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am Oghenefejiro Isaacs Anigboro, a Senior now at Speedway HS, Speedway, IN. I plan to go to college next year, 2022, and study Software Engineering as a major and hopefully minor in two other different CS fields and Math.
                        I enjoy coding, discovering and learning, collaborating with like-minded people, I also enjoy watching and playing football (soccer), solving Math, listening to music, and exceeding expectations. I have always been a person interested
                        in CS and I believe it is because I got my first computer at a young age (6) which I explored and ended up crashing it.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutext">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I moved from Nigeria to the United States back in August, 2019, the same year I graduated from High school there. Back in Nigeria, it was somewhat of a struggle to learn more about CS because in schools, we were taught more
                        of the theoretical aspect and history of CS and never really the practical aspect. My first involvement with the practical aspect of CS was back in 2018 when I qualified in my state for an ICT Olympiad competition. There, I was
                        sent to a bootcamp to learn about websites and I thought I did, but we were only taught the basic HTML structure and no real styling. At the competition, I was amazed about the wonderful websites which people had built and disappointed
                        about mine.
                    </p>
                    <p class="aboutext">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wasn’t able to continue my journey in CS because I was in my last year of HS and I had to focus on the final 4 major exams I had to take. After that, the following year, I came here and I started looking at websites again
                        and inspecting the pages. This drew my attention more into CS and in my junior year (last school year) I decided to take APCSP which drew my attention into CS even more. Schooling here, I have faced a lot of challenges (which some
                        might classify as struggles) which I am happy that I could overcome. From being a nobody in my school to making it to Top 20 (of class 2022) in my Junior year and participating in sports here, from Football (Soccer) to track. Throughout
                        this summer I was blessed with the opportunity of being a Catapult and I have grown from just being able to make a website structure and add a few things to building this amazing website (through the help of Jill, Steve, the TA’s,
                        Google and Youtube) which you are viewing right now. I hope you like it!!!
